# My Volleyball Journey

### On 19th July,
I arrived in Los Angeles by plane. Though coming to the US for the summer wasn't initially
my idea, I got pretty excited. After a few months in a rut, stuck not being able to focus on work and
spending my time procrastinating in front of a screen, I was looking to start fresh and do something
social and physical. I went to Huntington Beach by bus, something that people apparently don't do here,
and my first surprise was that no one on that bus spoke English.
My second shock in coming was just how far apart everything is. I spent the first few
days shopping for things I'd need during my stay, and shops and offices that didn't look particularly far on the map summed
up to walking 30 miles each day. Of course I was white as a ghost and successfully got sunburned on my first
walk.

After a couple of days, I finally got to go to the beach. To avoid getting sunburned, I set off late afternoon
and jumped into the ocean. I can't say that was the best idea, as the ocean was really cold, it was windy,
and to my surprise, even the air was quite cold. I dismissed the possibility of spending my summer bathing
in the ocean.

As I was walking further along the beach, I came across the Newland volleyball courts. I remembered that
the person I'm staying with suggested that I can just talk someone up and start playing with them. Not
that it would be easy for someone introverted, not used to American culture, and who also happens
to have 0 volleyball skills. Still, I thought the sport would be fun. That's when I spotted Cole setting
up a fit class at one of the courts and I got intrigued. He told me about Insand and suggested I go try
out my first class. I jumped in without thinking and started my volleyball journey.

## 24th July 2024,
I'm standing at a beach volleyball court without any idea what I'm getting into. We do
a few rounds of body weight exercises, not unlike the things I would do at the gym at home. Still, it's
pretty high intensity and I find myself grasping for breath. Luckily for me, we don't even touch the ball
during the first hour. I get through the fit class and see people gathering to play actual volleyball.
At first, I only intend to watch and decide if I want to join, but after a couple of minutes, I put myself
back together (high stamina from walking a lot is paying off) and my fear of missing out makes me want to
play too. I pass the ball around a few times with a partner and my forearms start stinging, not at all
used to the impact of the ball.

I don't remember much of the content of the first class, but I do remember that I did everything wrong.
Though I'm used to moving around, my natural instincts weren't much help when it came to playing the game.
My intuition of

- *Everyone who plays volleyball is really tall, so you have to stay as high as you possibly can** and

- *The ball is flying over there so you have to run under it as fast as possible*

are in direct opposition
to the tips I'm receiving, which makes it hard, and there's a lot of information I'm not able to absorb
at once. I find myself running directly under the ball and then getting stuck in an awkward position where
I can't set over or underhand. The ball is just setting off in seemingly random directions as I flail around
helplessly. Still, Cole looks surprisingly hopeful and tells me I'm naturally athletic and will be able to
get it all with some practice. I decide I'm going to prove him right and commit myself to volleyball.

## 25th July,
I miss the morning class at the beach, but luckily find an afternoon alternative at Goldenwest.
"My first week in the US prepared me exactly for this moment", I think as I check where the place is and
Google maps claim it's 2.5 hours on foot. I put on music and set off.

Upon arriving, I talk to a second coach, who welcomes me into the class, excited someone is doing the small
fit class instead of just coming in to play. Naturally, if I want to get better, I want to learn how to move
properly. The fit class is fine, but when the VolleySkills class starts, I find myself regretting it. After
the 8 mile walk and fitness training, we barely start playing and my thighs are already **on fire**. I get
through the class messing everything up but collecting new, valuable information. At this point, the most
difficult part of training is not that my legs are refusing to move, or the fact that I can't hit the ball,
but realising whoever gets paired up with me is destined to lose. I end the class ashamed of my lack of skills
but everyone welcomes me with open arms and gives me helpful tips. One member suggests I should pass the ball against
a wall as much as possible to get practice at home. I don't hesitate, find something cheap in Walmart that
says "volleyball" on it and go buy it on my way home.

### 26th July,
I check the schedule and find that there is no class at the beach, or Goldenwest. I could handle
the 2 hour walk to Goldenwest, but 8 hours to Irvine is a bit too much, even for me. Instead, I decide to
take the player's advice and instead of embarassing myself in front of everyone else, I go practice to the
local park, in an area with high walls that tennis players use. If there is a single thing that helped me
get better at the game, it was this very decision. In total, I must have done over a hundred passes against
the wall. Some feel better than others, but the ball is still flying in all kinds of directions, leaving me
exhausted from sprinting around to catch it. After every single pass, I try to recall all the tips I collected,
and analyze what I did differently from the suggestions. Around my 100th one, something finally clicks and
the pass feels completely different from all the others. Like a lightbulb lighting up in my head, I realised
why that went exactly where I wanted it to: I squatted under it and pushed it with my legs instead of trying
to use my arms. I feel like I just unlocked a superpower.

### 27th July,
I wake up after a couple of hours of sleep and my legs are not cooperating with me. Not only
do I have sore thighs from my newly acquired power, my feet have blisters from walking around on all the
asphalt in trek shoes. The way to the beach is excrutiating, but setting my feet free and stepping into
the sand feels surprisingly therapeutic. I face my hardest fit yet, but find myself thanking my stamina
again. Even though I'm completely exhausted after the workout, I recover in a couple of minutes.

During the class, I am once again bombarded with new information, but Cole tells me to just focus on
getting to the ball and getting it into the air. Easier said than done, but good advice nonetheless.
I'm excited when I finally get
into a game, but it turns out that people are a much tougher enemy than the wall. I remember staring down
the person against me and trying to remember all the information I gathered so far. I plant my feet in
the sand, squat down, put my arms in front of me, ready to form a platform. *Perfect*, I think as I focus
on my posture and the ball flies by right next to me. Oops, forgot to move my legs.

In some ways, my practice is paying off, but when faced with the ball coming in from all directions, I still
keep messing it up. Here's what I did right though: after every play, I'd stop for a few seconds and
think about why that went right or wrong.

- *The ball was too close to my chest*.

- *The ball was too far from my chest, and I hit it with my hands*.

- *Why were my feet in that position?*

- *I moved too fast*.

- *I moved too slow*.

Not to toot my own horn here, but there's another thing I did right: after this short
analysis, I'd let it go and would not get frustrated over it. This stoic approach is definitely the most
crucial skill when trying to learn a new skill; getting frustrated, saying I don't have the talent and
ultimately quitting would have been the easy way out.

### 29th July,
I'm immediately humbled as we do a passing drill in really strong wind. Literally nothing is going
where I want it to and I'm just about ready to go home and cry. My only comfort is that even the
more experienced players seem to be struggling, so I can pretend I'm not the problem.

### A week in,
I'm still terrible at the game, but I can feel all the progress I've made. My body is getting
used to the workouts, and my movement in the sand is way better, I'm just not hitting the ball right.
I have a revelation that I don't exactly need to be good at the game to be useful, as long as I manage
to get to the ball and get it as high as possible. Finally, I'm starting to feel like I serve a purpose
on the court other than looking pretty.

That's when I realize that Cole's initial analysis was spot on.
In a way, I think I had quite a headstart compared to a lot of the other Insand members in that I started
off already fairly athletic. I'm starting to feel that when you already know how to move, the rest falls into place much easier. During an
attacking class, I remember being told to swing my arms back when jumping. At first, I think it's a little strange, but
during the next fit class, we do some two-legged jumping forward; and I realize I've been swinging my arms back to
get more power into my jump my whole life, I just never did it in volleyball.
At this point it's like I'm playing a minigame in my head, trying to put together all the pieces of information
I'm told, and I can feel this piece falling into the right place.

This is also when I really start to appreciate how nice the Insand community is. The more experienced
players are giving me tips, and everyone is giving me compliments on getting mediocre plays right.
When you're surrounded by people who are nice and want to get better, the volleyball practically teaches
itself.

I also meet another person who's just starting out and I immediately feel a nice sense of closeness, since
she's in the same position as me. We're both fairly fit but have absolutely no technique.
Moments later, I perhaps feel a bit too much closeness as I proceed to
get kicked in the face after we screw up a ball and both go after it.
At least she taught me the secret technique of **Still counts**: As long as you manage to touch the ball,
it still counts no matter how horrible or against the actual rules that is. A good motto to live by
in the state I'm in.

### It is now August,
and my second Friday of doing my own drills comes up. I decide that instead
of just getting the ball up in the air, it's time to learn how to hit it. I go to my wall and start
serving. Here comes the now familiar drill, as I try to recall every single serving tip I've gotten.

- *This toss was too low*.

- *I tossed that in front of me instead of above me*.

- *I tossed that over my head instead of my shoulder*.

- *I hesitated and didn't hit that at my highest point*.

I screw up dozens of times and finally get one right after approx. 80 attempts. I do a medium high toss
over my right shoulder, twist my hips and hit the ball full force at my highest contact point.
Starting to see a pattern here.

Not that I've mastered serving in any imaginable way, but at my next class, I'm able to get all my
serves on the correct side of the field, something that only I can truly appreciate knowing how bad I
was at it to start with.

Now that I'm somewhat capable of keeping the ball in play, I'm starting to experience longer rallies,
and somehow find myself really winded after them. I wonder if I'm not athletic enough after all, but
somehow the coaches know exactly what to say to me to get better. The answer comes to me during my second
saturday class, as I'm doing a fit exercise with Fern and she tells me "Calm down and breathe" as I'm running
for the ball. Another
piece clicks into place as I realise that between trying to get down my footwork, posture, arm position
and watching the ball, I've been forgetting to breathe. The most basic human action.

### By the end of my second week,
the most notable change I notice  is that the workouts have gotten so much easier.
One class a day no longer feels like enough, so I'm starting a new Tuesday routine:

- Wake up after 4-5 hours of sleep.

- Do Fit and Skills class.

- Go home to take a nap.

- Set out for Goldenwest to do the afternoon class there.

My suspicions about how much stronger I've gotten are confirmed as I visit the gym for the first time here
and get a new personal record on my squat; 40 pounds more than just a month ago. Spending a day doing 4 hours
of volleyball and 6 hours of walking really does that to a man.

### As I'm starting my third week,
I'm still making more than enough mistakes, but with every touch of the volleyball, I can
feel that I'm just a tiny bit better. After one of the classes, a fellow member approaches me and tells me
"When you were playing, the coach said that's a really good pass for someone 2 weeks in".
I knew the coaches were up to something and I finally caught them
red handed, saying nice things about me being my back like that. That's when I finally get some sense of pride in all
the effort I put in. But I also have to remind myself it's only good for someone 2 weeks in, not *actually* good,
and I can't afford to stop growing.

If anything is a testament to how much I've grown, it's the increasing complexity of my own drill.
I am now capable of doing a drill where I hit a high attack against the wall, receive the ball, set it to myself
and attack again. Not that I can successfully do multiple of those in a row, but I feel that I'm moving forward at a good
pace.

### Tuesday August 13th,
the end of my third week, we do a passing drill and for the first time, it feels like the things
I've learned came together. Can't tell if it was skill or just a lack of sleep, but I'm able to stay perfectly
calm during the drill, and do all the right things. I'd move to the right spot, get a solid footing, get my
platform straight and then bounce the ball right where I wanted it to go.
After getting relentlessly bullied by volleyball for 20 days, it's time for me to be in control. And it feels so
good.

This is also the moment where I realize just how hard of a sport I picked. I'm making it sound like a great accomplishment,
but bouncing the ball off of your hands is the very simplest move in the game. And unfortunately, real games are
not drills, and I'm not even able to do that consistently. That's when I realize the hill I've been climbing is really
just the foot of the mountain, and until now I could not see beyond the cloud of the very basics. Despite coming in
to every possible class, I'm still learning a new piece of information every time.

It starts to feel like I could be playing the sport for 10 years and still not be good and in a way, I find myself
frustrated for wasting the last 10 years not playing volleyball. However, I definitely see the bright side of starting
as an adult:

- I don't think I'd be capable of the right mindset to get the most out of it as a teenager. I can definitely
imagine myself just saying I don't have the talent and giving up on it.

- I immediately get corrected by the coaches when I do things wrong and don't build bad habits from the start.

### The start of my 4th week
is not particularly eventful. Though I'm still learning new things, some of the drills become familiar.
This is where I have to appreciate the fact that we get multiple coaches and get slightly different approaches
to the same seemingly simple yet so complex game. We do a standing drill with Kahlee with the intention of hitting
a cutshot with a very specific trajectory over the net; different from what I've done so far yet very informative
and efficient in the amount of reps you can get.

And don't get me started on Ben's classes. I don't know if they're harder or if I'm getting performance anxiety, but
I feel like I just do worse than in others. He does this thing where you screw up and he asks you "What went wrong there?",
rubbing salt right into your wounds. But verbalizing the problem and hearing feedback from another person is exteremely helpful.

After Reid sees me completely fail at trying to toss the ball to myself, he tells us "I see a lot of opportunity for practice here"
and that's by far the nicest way anyone has ever told me I suck.

### Throughout the week
I still dread attacking classes. Though I've gotten much better at passing I feel like I can either do the approach right,
jump correctly, or actually hit the ball. But not two of those, much less all three.
In addition, it's quite a bit harder to practice attacking scenarios compared to everything
else. In response, I go to the gym and work on my 4 steps into a high
jump on top of a wooden box. The moment I get it right and realize how much forward momentum I'm getting from a correct step-close, another
piece of the puzzle clicks and I get excited. Now I just need to learn how to hit the ball.

This is where I get my first glimpses of actually trying to watch the court. However, I find that so much of my brainpower
is still focused on the basics that I can't process all the other things that are happening. Thoughts of
*Where's my partner? Where are the enemy players? Where should this ball go to score a point?*
are still getting pushed out by *Stay low and keep your arms straight, dummy*, as I feel that when I try to do
something advanced I just forget all the basics in a flash. I would have never guessed just how much thinking
you have to do on the court.

### By the end of my 4th week
I can feel myself getting much more patient about my approach and gaining the confidence to wait and watch the ball before
setting off. Yet as I jump towards it, I realize I don't know where I want to shoot it, get lost in thought mid-air and
bump it gently, scoring more by accident than intention.

We do a class focused on hard digs and I realize just how much further I can get with a big stepover, and how many balls
that I would've given up on I can get by diving for them. If anything is more satisfying than getting an attack right,
it's digging a seemingly impossible ball and keeping it in play.

### Now that I'm a month in,
I feel like I'm finally playing actual volleyball, instead of just flailing around. I'm still making plenty of
mistakes and I can see it taking a long time before I've at least automated the basics to the point where I don't need
to think about them. I'm capable of getting things right, but not consistently.

As I'm playing the game, I feel an almost sudden change in what goes on in my head during the game. Instead of just
putting all my focus towards keeping the ball in play and getting it over *somehow*, I can feel myself watching the court.

- In one of the games I manage to make a good pass, set out at the right time, and shoot an intentionally
low ball at the line. And it just felt so incredible scoring with *intention* after
all of this time, I just started grinning with pride.

- After getting scored on multiple times from a strong attacker, I visualize a scenario where I can beat him:
I serve very low against the other player, the strong attacker won't be in a position
to attack and we'll get the point. I feel like a genius when my plan actually works,
immediately forgetting that the overall score is still 5:1 for him.

The journey to actually starting to play this game was hard but the highs are so worth it.
And if this is just the beginning, I couldn't be more excited for what's to come. I love this sport so much.
